# Case Study: Raiz Invest

## Overview and Origin

Raiz Invest is a micro investment platform that operates in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Formerly known as Acorns Grow Australia the company was founded in Feb 2016 as a joint venture between the American FinTech start-up Acorns Inc and the Australian company [Instreet Investments](https://www.instreet.com.au).

### Early beginnings
According to Crunchbase, Jeffrey Cruttenden co-founded Acorns with his father Walter Cruttenden in 2012 to ==radically simplify and democratise investing== [ˆ1]
>"While in college, Jeff realised that most of his classmates were not able to come up with the lump sum needed to meet minimum balance requirements. Acorns was hatched as an investment application to allow people to easily invest their spare change into diversified portfolios."

### Expanding to Australia
The joint venture with Instreet Investments, co-founded by George Lucas and Brendan Malone, was formed to take advantage of the experience and knowledge of a local company while launching in Australia.

### From Acorns to Raiz

The subsequent rebrand to Raiz Invest in 2018 was part of a strategy to move away from the US Acorns brand and develop a financial product tailored towards the Australian market. In May 2018 the company announced its Public Offering providing their customers with priority access to shares issued at $1.80, with a total valuation of approx. $119 million, and successfully raising $15.12 million. [ˆ2] 

Raiz Invest was first listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on the 21s of June 2018. [ˆ3]

As of November 2022, Raiz Invest has raised $16 million, and its current share price ($0.47) represents a 73.89% discount to its original price. [ˆ4]
