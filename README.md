# Case Study: Raiz Invest

## Overview and Origin

Raiz Invest is a micro investment platform that operates in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia.

Formerly known as Acorns Grow Australia the company was founded in Feb 2016 as a joint venture between the American FinTech start-up Acorns Inc and the Australian company [Instreet Investments](https://www.instreet.com.au).

### Early beginnings
According to Crunchbase, Jeffrey Cruttenden co-founded Acorns with his father Walter Cruttenden in 2012 to "radically simplify and democratise investing" [^1]
>"While in college, Jeff realised that most of his classmates were not able to come up with the lump sum needed to meet minimum balance requirements. Acorns was hatched as an investment application to allow people to easily invest their spare change into diversified portfolios."

### Expanding to Australia
The joint venture with Instreet Investments, co-founded by George Lucas and Brendan Malone, was formed to take advantage of the experience and knowledge of a local company while launching in Australia.

### From Acorns to Raiz

The subsequent rebrand to Raiz Invest in 2018 was part of a strategy to move away from the US Acorns brand and develop a financial product tailored towards the Australian market. In May 2018 the company announced its Public Offering providing their customers with priority access to shares issued at $1.80, with a total valuation of approx. $119 million, and successfully raising $15.12 million. [^2] 

Raiz Invest was first listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on the 21s of June 2018. [^3]

As of November 2022, Raiz Invest has raised $16 million, and its current share price ($0.47) represents a 73.89% discount to its original price. [^4]

## Landscape
Raiz Invest Limited is under the "Wealth Management" FinTech domain, and it is listed on the ASX under the Diversified 
Financials industry group. 

Traditionally, if you need to find someone who can provide advice on investments in Australia, the first step would be to 
google for Financial Advisors in your area or perhaps asking a friend. Then, if you are cautious enough, you would visit 
the [Financial advisers register](https://moneysmart.gov.au/financial-advice/financial-advisers-register) to make sure you 
are dealing with a legitimate Business. Next, depending on the service you require, you have to take into consideration 
the Fees, which may include: Financial plan fee, Implementation fee, Ongoing advice fees, Investment management fees, etc.
You could end-up paying thousands of dollars each year in management fees that are deducted from your investment returns.

After the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, Banks lost credibility and trust, which opened a window for new providers. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies emerged. Additionally, the adoption of Smartphones has resulted in an increase demand 
for online services. Cloud Services like AWS offering a pay-as-you-go approach have made Technologies more attainable for 
new Companies. The Technologically literate Consumers no longer consider the traditional Wealth Management model good 
enough. All these trends have translated into an increase of startup Businesses using Technology to change the game in the 
financial market and compete against the giants by making these services more accessible.
